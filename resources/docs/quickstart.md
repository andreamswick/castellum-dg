On the [homepage](/home) you can view all of the events that have been scheduled. If you prefer a list view, click [Visits](/visits) in the navigation bar or on the [Scheduled Visits](/visits) title of the calendar panel.

### [Creating a Visit](/visit/create)

To create a visit click on the "+" button in the header of the Scheduled Visits panel or on the header of the panel on the visits page. Visits have a name (i.e. English Tutoring) and a start date & time and an end date & time. You can also select who is coming, you may select and number of people in addition to yourself. Then click save, and you are all set!
