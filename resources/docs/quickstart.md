# Quickstart

## [Visits](/visits)

On the [homepage](/home) you can view all of the events that have been scheduled. If you prefer a list view, click [Visits](/visits) in the navigation bar or on the [Scheduled Visits](/visits) title of the calendar panel.

### [Creating a Visit](/visit/create)

To create a visit click on the "+" button in the header of the Scheduled Visits panel or on the header of the panel on the visits page. Visits have a name (i.e. English Tutoring) and a start date & time and an end date & time. You can also select who is coming, you may select and number of people in addition to yourself. Then click save, and you are all set! 

#### After a Visit

After you go on a visit to our family, please log back on and go to your event and add some comments about how it went, and if there is anything the family needs.

### Editing a Visit

To edit a visit click on the Visits tab in the navigation bar, and find the visit you wish to edit and click the yellow pencil button. You will be taken to an edit form which is exactly the same as the create form. Here you will be able to edit the name, start and end dates and times as well as the people who are coming.

## [Items](/items)
