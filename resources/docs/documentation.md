## Create a new page

There are two steps to creating a new page: Create the page and add it to the links on the left side.

### The new page

1. **Add a title:** the title will become the file name as well as the name you will use to link to the page in the next step.
2. **Add the content:** the content area is in markdown, but it doesn't matter if you don't know what that means! The content area has a editor that will work similarly to most text editors (i.e. Word, Google Docs) which will help you format the content in the way you would like.
3. Don't forget to save!

### Adding it to the links

If the page will be for Admins only click the yellow edit button in the "Admin" panel, if it is for everyone who has access to the application, click the yellow edit button in the "Getting Started" panel. This will bring you to a page similar to the create page were you can add a new link to the list. 

For example if you created a new page with the title "Hello World" you would add 

`- [Hello World](/docs/hello-world)` 

on a new line. The `-` means that the link is a part of the list. The brackets are where the title of the link will go, and inside the parentheses the you will add `/docs/` plus the title in *lower case* and replacing any *spaces* with `-`. 

Look to the other lines in the content area for guidance or contact [Andrea Swick](mailto:andreamswick@gmail.com) for help.

## Update an existing page

Click the yellow Edit {page title} link in the top right of the main panel. This will bring you to a page where you can type in content. The content area is in markdown, but it doesn't matter if you don't know what that means! The content area has a editor that will work similarly to most text editors (i.e. Word, Google Docs) which will help you format the content in the way you would like. When you are finished click the blue save button to save your changes.
