[FCC UCC Downers Grove](http://uccdg.org/) with St. Luke's Presbyterian, St. Paul's UCC, Mecca House Mosque, and several other  faith communities in Downers Grove sponsored a refugee family to make a new life in the United States through [RefugeeOne](http://www.refugeeone.org/). 

Since multiple churches were involved they wanted one place to:
- Track needed and recieved supplies for the family
- Track visits of members to the family
- Share announcements

This app also has:
- Basic role management using [Spatie's Laravel Permission](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission) package
- Editable documentation inspired by [Laravel's documentation](https://github.com/laravel/laravel.com)
